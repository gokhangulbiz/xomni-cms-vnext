#XOMNI CMS vNext
Our next generation CMS is located in this repository. 

From now on all of the new features getting implemented in our CMS with every upcomming version of our APIs will be build on this infrastructure. Our plan is to migrate all of the current screens to the next generation but we don't want that to hold us releasing the next generation either. That's why we are going to run the next generation and the current gen together in a hybrid mode for a while during the upcomming product releases. 

Feel free to contribute. We will release our conribution guidelines to help you out as soon as possible. We are working on it!
 
Meanwhile, if you happened to land here without an overview of our APIs take a look at [http://dev.xomni.com/](http://dev.xomni.com/) for more information and full documentation of our API set.

Thanks.
